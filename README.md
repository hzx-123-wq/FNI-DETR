#### train ####
Before training the dataset, you first need to change the dataset path in the file under the path "ultralytics/cfg/datasets/" to your own path. We recommend that you use an absolute path.
We put the training files of COCO dataset and VisDrone dataset into run-coco.py and run-vis.py respectively. We only need to change the file path to start training.
